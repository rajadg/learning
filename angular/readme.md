# Basics
## Starting Angular
To start working with angular project we must install the angular cli. This angular cli is later used to create a new angular project or add more module/component/service/etc to an existing angular project. Once the angular cli is installed (globally using npm), we can use this to create a new project, add components, build/run the project.
### Steps 
1. Install angular/cli using the following command:

   >npm install -g @angular/cli

   * The above command installs angular cli latest version. For angular 7 development, use `@angular/cli@7.3.9`
2. Create a new Project:
   >ng new myproj
    
   * The above command if run first time on a PC will take a few minutes to download all the angular related libraries from internet. Second time onwards the time taken will be less.
3. Once the project is created we can run the project using the following command:
   >ng serve
   
   * This will now start the angular application and serve in port 4200. We can access the angular application using url http://localhost:4200
    _Note: By default a new project will have tutorial 'tour or heroes', but we can modify the project easily to have the UI we need._

4. Add components to angular app for new UI:
    >ng generate component mycomp

    * This will generate a component (a UI component with typescript file, HTML template, CSS style) of name 'mycomp'. We can also use a short form for the above command: *`ng g c mycomp`* which is easy to type in the commandline.

5. We can also build the angular project so that it can be deployed on a server. To do this use the following command:
   >ng build

6. We can also run the angular in watch mode so that changes are immediately auto-compiled and rendered in the webpage:
   >ng serve -o --watch

    * Here the `-o` option is to open the url `http://localhost:4200` in the browser. The `--watch` option is to ensure the `ng` will recompile and serve the application whenever a change is saved.

## Angular Project Structure
### app folder
All the active code for an angular application will be inside the sub-folder `./src/app`. 
#### app-component
The app component is the main component in the application and all other components are generally placed inside the app component.
   * The `./src/app/app.component.html` file contains the HTML template for the app  component.
   * The `./src/app/app.component.ts` file contains the typescript code for this component.
   * The `./src/app/app.component.css` file contains the styles used by the HTML template.
   * The  `./src/app/app.component.spec.ts` file contains the unit tests for this component.

_Note: It is possible to change the opening component of the application to something other than app component. Simply replace the `app-root` tag in the `./src/index.html` with the tag of the desired component to acheive this._

#### other application files
* The  `./src/app/app.module.ts` file contains the module class for the whole application.
* The  `./src/app/app-routing.module.ts` file contains the routing configuration to other components inside the angular application.

### assets foler
The `./src/assets` folder is used to house the localized resource files (translated UI strings) and images. It can also contain any other media required the application that is small enough to be deployed along with angular application.

### environment folder
The same angular application can be hosted in different environments (e.g: Development, Testing, Production, etc). To do this we can create one configuration file per enviroment inside this `./src/environment` folder. Example for development we can create environment.dev.ts, for production we can use environment.prod.ts, etc.
According to the build/run configuration done in the angular.json file appropriate environment file will be loaded at build time.

### angular.json
This file contains the angular project configuration. All the build settings for angular are configured in this file.

### tsconfig.json
This file contains the typescript configuration as the angular application runs on typescript. We can configure the ECMA version, typescript rules, etc in this file.


## Components
A component controls a part (or patch) of the screen which is called the view. A component consists of a HTML Template (visible in UI), a class which contains the client side script (logic) and a style sheet. A whole Web page of the angular App can be made of one component or it could be comprised of multiple components based on what is required for the Web application.
### Component Structure
![Component Structure](./images/component-databinding.png)
* `Template <>` - This is the HTML template which uses the Angular Template syntax
* `Commponent {}` - This is the typescript class that controls the component
* `Metadata` - This is @ directive in the component's typescript class which links the HTML Template and Stylesheet to the typescript class

### Creation
To add new component we can use angular cli. The following command will create a new component by name `test`:
>ng generate component test

#### Genearted Files
The generated component will have 4 files:
* `test.component.ts` - The typescript class for this component
* `test.component.spec.ts` - The unit test class for this component
* `test.component.html` - The HTML template for this component
* `test.component.css` - The style sheet for this component.

The stylesheet will be initially empty, whereas the HTML template will have a simple placemark HTML tag. This should be replaced with the desired HTML content to be rendered in the UI.
The `test.component.spec.ts` is an auto-generated unit test file, and we can write our unit tests inside this file to test our component.
The `test.component.ts` is the auto-generated component typescript class. Add the logic for this component inside this file. A newly created component class looks like this:
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-test',
  templateUrl: './test.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./test.component.css']
})
export class TestComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit() {  }
}
```
#### Using a Component
The `@Component` directive is the metadata part of this component that links the class `TestComponent` with the HTML template and stylesheet. It also defines a selector `app-test` for this component. This enables us to use this component inside another component (in the HTML template) like this: 
```HTML
<test-component></test-component>
```
We can also create the component with a very short command line: 
>ng g c test

Here the `generate` is cut short as `g` and the `component` is cutshort as `c`. This short commandline is meant to simplify the component creation command line and also reduces chances of typing errors.

To import a component or module in another file use the typescript import syntax:
```typescript
import { MyComponent } from './subfolder/my-component'; // If the component is a local component (exclude .ts extension when importing)
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; // If the component is from angular library
```

### Inline Template
A small component limited HTML/CSS content can be defined with iniline definitions like this:
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'app-para',
  template: `<p> test paragraph </p>`,
  styles: []
})
export class ParaComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit() { }
}
```
Note that to define inline HTML and css we are using `template` instead of `templateUrl` and `styles` instead of `styleUrls` in the metadata. We can also generate a component with inline template and inline styles by using `-it` (for inline template) and `-is` (for inline style) in the commandline while generating the component.
>ng g c my-component -it -is

### Three ways to specify a Selector
- The above component can be included in another component as a HTML like tag. 
- If we need to use a component as a css class, the selector directive should be like `.app-para`.
- If we need to use the component like an attribute, the selector directive should be like `[app-para]`.

## Interpolation
Interpolation means rendering the value of a property from the typescript class in the HTML side. For example, if we have a property `name` in the typescript class we can display the value of the name in the HTML by using the syntax: `{{name}}`. If we type `Welcome {{name}}` in HTML and define the value of `name` as `Guest`, then the browser will display this HTML as `Welcom Guest`.
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: '[app-welcome]',
  template: 'Welcome {{name}}',
  styles: []
})
export class WelcomeComponent implements OnInit {
  private name = 'Guest';
  constructor() { }
  ngOnInit() {  }
}
```
The above component will be displayed in the browser as:
> Welcome Guest


If we change the vlaue of `name` property dynamically, immediately the contents displayed in the browser will change to reflect the new value of the name.

The content inside the `{{` `}}` pair is treated as a javascript expression and will be evaluated before being rendered in the browser. Which means if we use `{{name.toUpperCase()}}` in the HTML then the text displayed in the browser will be like this:
> Welcome GUEST

We can also use any arithmetic expression, method call, etc inside the `{{` `}}` pair; the content will be evaluated as a javascript expression and the browser will display the result of the evaluated expression. We can use `{{2+2}}` in HTML template and it will be displayed as `4` in the browser.

#### Interpolation Limits
* We can only use an expression within a `{{` `}}` pair. But a javascript assignment statement like `{{a=2+2}}` is not allowed.
* The expression inside the `{{` `}}` pair cannot make use of global javascript variables like `window`. For example, if we try `{{window.location.href}}` this will raise an error, instead of displaying the current URL value. If we need to use global javascript variables with interpolation, we need to first assign the value of global variable to a property in the component's typescript class. Then we can use this property in the HTML template using inerpolation.

# Bindings
There are different binding concepts available in Angular:
1. **Property Binding** - Binding a attribute in the HTML element to a typescript property / expression. Data travels from typescript to HTML element.
    * Example: `<img [height]='imageHeight'>...` (`imageHeight` is a typescript property / expression)
2. **Class Binding** - Binding the class attribute of HTML element to a typescript property / expression. Data from typescript is used by the class attribute in the HTML element.
    * Example: `<img [class]='className'>...` (`className` is a typescript property / expression)
3. **Style Binding** - Binding the style attribte of a HTML element to a typescript property / expression. Data from typescript is used by the class attribute in the HTML element.
    * Example: `<img [style]='styleData'>...` (`styleData` is a typescript property / expression)
4. **Event Binding** - Binding the event in HTML template to a typescript statement. Whenever the event occurs on the HTML element, the typescript statement will be execute. Typically in place of typescript statement as typescript method will be called.
    * Example: `<img (click)='onClick()'>...` (`onClick` is a typescript method / statement)
5. **Template reference Variables** - Bind a HTML element itself to a typescript property by using the `#` notation. From typescript code we can access the HTML DOM element using this typescript property.
    * Example: `<input #myName type='text'>...` (`myName` can be used like a typescript property but it does not have to be explicity declared in the typescript class)
6. **Two way binding** - Bind the value of the HTML element using the ngModel attribute. The ngModel attribute is declared in the Angular Forms. If the value of the model is changed in typescript, the UI value also changes. If UI value is edited, automatically the typescript property value also reflects the latest value.
    * Example: `<input [(ngModel)]='myName type='text'>...` (`myName` is a typescript property that is explicity declared in the typescript class)

Here is the detailed overview of different types of bindings:

## Property Binding
Property binding is similar to interpolation where the change in the value of property in the typescript class will reflect in the the HTML that is rendered in the browser. The interpolation has limited scope and cannot affect the DOM. But property binding can affect the DOM when the value of the property changes inside the typescript class.
There are two ways to do property binding:
-  **Enclosing inside `[]`** - We can simply enclose the property inside `[]` like this: `<img [height]='imageHeight'>...` and then declare the property `imageHeight` in the typescript class as `class ImageComponent { ... private imageHeight = 200; ...`.
- **Prefixing with `bind-`** - Prefixing the attribute name with `bind-`ensures the attribute is bound to typescript property. HTML: `<img bind-height='imageHeight' ...>` and typescript class:  `class ImageComponent { ... private imageHeight = 200; ...`.

Either way, the data travels in only one way: The data can be changed inside the typescript class, it will be reflected in the HTML in browser. Any changes to the attribute in the DOM in the browser will not reflect back in the typescript class property. Refer the direction of property binding in the `Component Strucuture` picture above.

## Class Binding
Class binding is like property binding, but can be done in three different ways:
1. **Simple Binding** - Binds one or more CSS Classes to HTML element. Bind the class attribute using basic property binding => `[class]="propName"` where propName is the property from typescript class that can change at run time.
2. **Binding by Condition** - Binds single class to HTML element based on condition. Bind the class attribute based on condition => `[class.cssName]="condition"` where `condition` is a javascript expression, and `cssName` is a valid css class name from style sheet.
3. **ngClass Binding** - Binds one or more CSS Classes to HTML element. Bind using ngClass attribute to a map of flags => `[ngClass]="mapName"` where mapName is the property from typescript class which is map of flags(true/false value). Name of each flag is same as css class name from style sheet.

### 1. Simple Binding
We can bind the class attribute to the property like property binding. To have this type of class binding to an element in the HTML we should use the syntax `[class]="propName"`, where the `propName` is the name of property in typescript class. The value of this property can be set to any valid CSS class name.
**`Example`**
**CSS**
```css
.errMsg {color: red;}
.infoMsg {color: black;}
.successMsg {color: green;}
```
**HTML**
```HTML
<div [class]='activeStyle'>This is target message</div>
```
**Typescript**
```typescript
class MyComponent {
    private activeStyle = 'infoMsg';
    onError() {
        this.activeStyle = 'errMsg';
    }
    onSuccess() {
        this.activeStyle = 'successMsg';
    }
}
```
### 2. Binding based on Condition
We can bind the class attribute to a specific class and enable it based on a condition. To have this type of class binding to an element in the HTML we should use the syntax ` [class.cssName]="condition"`, where the cssName is the name of the css class (from CSS file) and the condition is a typescript expression that will evaluate to true/false at runtime. When (at some point during user interaction) if the condition evaluates to try, the css class (cssName) will be applied. When the condition evaluates to false, the css class will be removed from the HTML element.
**`Example`**
**CSS** ```.errMsg {color: red;}```

**HTML** ```<div [class.errMsg]='hasError'>This is the status message</div>```

**Typescript**
```typescript
class MyComponent {
    private hasError = false;
    onError() {
        this.hasError = true;
    }
    onSuccess() {
        this.hasError = false;
    }
}
```
In the above example, the binding condition in HTML template uses the property `hasError` only (as any property evaluates as an expression). If required in place of `hasError` (in HTML template) we can use an expression in the HTML template.

### 3. Binding with ngClass directive
We can bind multiple CSS classes to a HTML element based on conditions by using the `ngClass` attribute. This will enable us to even have different combinations of styles at run time based on the state of the application at run time. To have this type of class binding to an element in the HTML we should use the syntax `[ngClass]="classMap"`, where the `classMap` is the property in the typescript. This classMap is an object and each member of this object is a valid CSS class name. The value of this member is either true or false based if the specific CSS class is required or not.
**`Example`**
**CSS**
```css
.errMsg {color: red;}
.largeMsg {font-size: large;}
.italicsMsg {font-style: italic;}
.underlinedMsg {text-decoration: underline;}
```
**HTML**
```HTML
<div [ngClass]='activeStyle'>This is target message</div>
```
**Typescript**
```typescript
class MyComponent {
        private activeStyle = {
        errMsg: false,
        largeMsg: false, 
        italicMsg: false,
        underlinedMsg: false,                  
    };
    false;
    onError() {
        this.activeStyle.errMsg = true;
    }
    onSuccess() {
        this.activeStyle.errMsg = false;
    }
    onHighlight() {
        this.activeStyle.largeMsg = true;
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `activeStyle` is an object and each member is the name of a valid CSS class in style sheet. If make any of this member true, then the specific CSS class will be applied to the HTML element.


## Style Binding
Style binding is like class binding and can be done in three different ways:
1. **Simple Binding** - Binds style attribute to typescript property, and the typescript property should hold the raw styles. Bind the style attribute using basic property binding => `[style]="styleData"` where styleData is the property from typescript class that can change at run time. The value of style data can be something like: `color: green; border: solid 1px black;`
2. **Binding by expression** - Binds single style in HTML element based on expression. Bind the style attribute based on expression => `[style.styleProp]="expression"` where `expression` is a javascript expression / typescript property, the `styleProp` is a valid css style like color, font, etc. Only one style property is allowed. The `expression` should evaluate to valid value for the style. For example if we use `[style.color]="colorValue"` in HTML template, then the typescript property `colorValue` can have only a valid color value like red, green, #ff00ff, etc.
3. **ngStyle Binding** - Binds one or more css styles to the HTML element. Bind using ngStyle attribute to a map of flags => `[ngStyle]="styleMap"` where `styleMap` is the property from typescript class which is map of styles. A style can be color, font, etc and the value can be valid value for that style.

### 1. Simple Binding Example

**HTML**
```HTML
<div [style]='activeStyle'>This is target message</div>
```
**Typescript**
```typescript
class MyComponent {
    private activeStyle = 'color: black;';
    onError() {
        this.activeStyle = 'color: red;';
    }
    onSuccess() {
        this.activeStyle = 'color: green;';
    }
}
```

### 2. Binding based on expression Example

**HTML**
```HTML
<div [style.color]='activeColor'>This is the status message</div>
```

**Typescript**
```typescript
class MyComponent {
    private activeColor = 'black';
    onError() {
        this.activeColor = 'red';
    }
    onSuccess() {
        this.activeColor = 'green';
    }
}
```

### 3. Binding with ngStyle directive Example

**HTML**
```HTML
<div [ngStyle]='myStyle'>This is target message</div>
```
**Typescript**
```typescript
class MyComponent {
    private myStyle = {
        color: 'black',
        fontSize: 'normal', 
        textDecoration: 'none',                  
    };
    onError() {
        this.myStyle.color = 'red';
        this.myStyle.textDecoration = 'underline';
    }
    onSuccess() {
        this.myStyle.color = 'green';
    }
    onHighlight() {
        this.myStyle.fontSize = 'large';
    }
}
```

# Structural Directives
Structural directives are angular directives that allows us to add or remove a HTML element in the Webpage dynamically. The directives use the typescript expressions for decision making, so the data in typescript class can influence the structure of the HTML web page at runtime. All the structural directives are used as attributes in an existing html tag. 
List of commonly used Structral directives:
* ngIf
* ngSwitch
* ngFor

There some more directives like ng-template, ng-container, etc which are used with the main directives.

## **ngIf** directive

The `ngIf` block is used to hide or show an element. This may look similar to `display: none/inline` style, but `ngIf` has a difference. The ngIf condition will not render the html tag itself (removed from HTML DOM), if the condition is false. The ngIf is an attribute with the value as a valid typescript expression. Syntax: ``<span `*ngIf='expression' ...> ... </span>`. The `span` tag is used as an example, but we can also other tags like div, table, p, etc. The `expression` can be either a single typescript property/method that evaluates to a boolean result, or we can have a full typescript expression.

** HTML Template **
```html
<span *ngIf='showWelcome'>
    Welcome Guest
</span>
```
** Typescript - Component class **
```typescript
@Component(...)
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
    boolean showWelcome = false;
    toggleWelcome() {
        this.showWelcome = !this.showWelcome;
    }
}
```
In the above example, whenever the `toggleWelcome()` method is called in the component, the welcome message will be displayed / hidden. When the welcome message is hidden, the `span` tag itself will be missing from the HTML DOM.

### ngTemplate block
The `ng-template` block is a HTML tag that has a name. This named template can be called from any one of the other directives like `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, etc. This is very helpful in `ngIf` directive when creating an else condition block.
```HTML
<ng-template #templateName>
    <!-- HTML content goes here -->
</ng-template>
```
In the above example, the `templateName` can be referred in other directives. When the above template is referred by the `templateName` then the content inside the ng-template will be rendered for the invoking scenario (e.g: ngIf condition).

### Using else condition
We can also use the else condition with `ngIf` to render alternate content when the condition is false. The syntax is `*ngIf='expression; else elseBlockName` where the `elseBlockName` is the name of the `ng-template` that holds the alternate content.

#### only else Block
** HTML Template **
```HTML
<div class='header'>
    <span *ngIf='isLoggedIn; else msgGuest'>
        Welcome {{userName}}
    </span>
    <ng-template #mgGuest>
        <span>Welcome Guest</span>
    </ng-template>
</div>
```

** Typescript - Component class **
```typescript
@Component(...)
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
    boolean isLoggedIn = false;
    boolean userName =  '';
    loginSuccess(user) {
        this.isLoggedIn = true;
        this.userName = user;
    }
}
```
In the above example, the HTML template will initially show the **Welcome Guest** message as the `isLoggedIn` flag value is false. But when the `loginSuccess` method is called, the `isLoggedIn` flag becomes true, so the **Welcome user** message will be displayed.

** Interpretation for `isLoggedIn = false` **
```HTML
<div class='header'>
    <span>Welcome Guest</span>
</div>
```
** Interpretation for `isLoggedIn = true` **
```HTML
<div class='header'>
    <span>Welcome {{userName}}</span>
</div>
```

#### Together then, else Blocks
We can also move the content of success case to one template and failure case to another template for an if-block. This helps to have a good html tags layout inside the HTML template.
** HTML Template **
```HTML
<div class='header'>
    <div *ngIf='isLoggedIn; then msgUser; else msgGuest'></div>
    <ng-template #mgGuest>
        <span>Welcome Guest</span>
    </ng-template>
    <ng-template #msgUser>
        <span>Welcome {{userName}}</span>
    </ng-template>
</div>
```

** Typescript - Component class **
```typescript
@Component(...)
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
    boolean isLoggedIn = false;
    boolean userName =  '';
    loginSuccess(user) {
        this.isLoggedIn = true;
        this.userName = user;
    }
}
```
In the above example, the HTML template will initially show the **Welcome Guest** message as the `isLoggedIn` flag value is false. But when the `loginSuccess` method is called, the `isLoggedIn` flag becomes true, so the **Welcome user** message will be displayed.

** Interpretation for `isLoggedIn = false` **
```HTML
<div class='header'>
    <div><span>Welcome Guest</span></div>
</div>
```
** Interpretation for `isLoggedIn = true` **
```HTML
<div class='header'>
    <div><span>Welcome {{userName}}</span></div>
</div>
```

### Advanced `*ngIf`
It is also possible to specify a template that is defined externally. Refer link: https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf#using-an-external-then-template

## ngSwitch
The `ngSwitch` directive behaves similar to the switch case statement used in various programming languages. Here is an example:
```HTML
<div [ngSwitch]='typescript-expression'>
    <div *ngSwitchCase='exp-value1'><!--case 1 HTML content goes here--></div>
    <div *ngSwitchCase='exp-value2'><!--case 2 HTML content goes here--></div>
    <div *ngSwitchCase='exp-value3'><!--case 3 HTML content goes here--></div>
    <div *ngSwitchDefault><!--default case HTML content goes here--></div>
</div>
```
Assign the value / expression to the `[ngSwitch]` attribute. This is similar to `switch(expression)` in javascript. Then for each case statement, use the `*ngSwitchCase` attribute with the target value. For the defalt scenario, use the `*ngSwitchDefault` attribute without any value for this attribute.

All the directives (`ngSwitch`, `ngSwitchCase`, `ngSwitchDefault`) should be attributes of a valid HTML tag.

## ngFor
The `ngFor` directive behaves similar to the for loop in various programming languages. The value of the `*ngFor` directive is a iteration definition that is very similar to the iteration definition used by the javascript  `for`-`of` loop. Here is an example:
```HTML
<div *ngFor='let item of list; index as i'>
    <span>{{item.value}} is at index {{i}}</span>
</div>
```
In the above example, the first part `let item of list` iterates the list. The list is a valid array defined in the typescript component class. The `item` is declared inside the HTML (inside ngFor) so it is valid inside the HTML tag that is using the ngFor directive. We can also define the index which is the second part in the ngFor `index as i`. This declares `i` as the index value in each iteration. We can also use other declarations like `last`, `odd`, `first`, `even`, etc. These are predefined boolean attributes of ngFor directive and works similar to the `index` attribute of ngFor.


# Routing

To create a project with routing option try the following commandline:
>ng new my-project --routing

To configure a route in existing project manually:
* Add the tag `<base href="/">` in the `./src/index.html` file. This is required if the project does not have routing support yet.
* Create a new file `app-routing.module.ts` which is the routing module for the application (class name `AppRoutingModule` decorated by `NgModule`).
* Import the `AppRoutingModule` in the app.module.ts file and also add it to the declarations in the `Imports` section of the AppModule.
* Add the routes in the `routes` array (type: `Routes`) in the `app-routing.module.ts` file. This array is a global variable outside the `AppRoutingModule` class.
    * Each routing entry is an object like this: ```{path: 'search`, component: `SearchComponent`}```. The `search` specifies the relative path in the Url and the `SearchComponent` is the actual component that will be loaded when url contains the `search` (example: `http://localhost:4200/search`).
* Pass the routes as a parameter (`RouterModule.forRoot(routes)`) as imports in the AppRoutingModule decorator.
* Add the `router-outlet` tag in the app.component.html file like this: ```<router-outlet></router-outlet>```
* To link to the new route from a web page, use the `a` tag with `routerLink` attribute (instead of href attribute). Example: `<a routerLink='./search' routerLinkActive='active'>Search</a>` where `routerLink='./search'` specifies the relative url of the component, and the `routerLinkActive='active'` is used to change the style of anchor when the active url is `./search`, the `active` is a css class.

**Example of RoutingModule (routing Module)**

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { Comp01Component } from './comp01/comp01.component';
import { Comp02Component } from './comp02/comp02.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {path: 'comp01', component: Comp01Component},
  {path: 'comp02', component: Comp02Component},
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```
**Example of HTML template (app component)**

```html
<div style="text-align:center">
  <h1>Welcome to {{ title }}!</h1>
</div>
<a routerLink='./comp01' routerLinkActive='active'>First Component</a>
<a routerLink='./comp02' routerLinkActive='active'>Second Component</a>
<br/>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

**Example of CSS file (app component)**

```css
a.active {
    background-color:#dfdfff;
    border: solid 1px lightblue;
};
```


## Wild Card Routes
We can also have wild card routes to handle all remaining routes not explicitly handled by available routes like this:

``` {path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent},```

The above entry should be the last route in the list of routes because the `**` will match with all given paths in url. So if we insert in first then other routes will never work. So always use wildcard routes as the last.
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {path: 'comp01', component: Comp01Component},
  {path: 'comp02', component: Comp02Component},
  {path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent},
];
```

But for empty route also the above routing configuraiton will display NotFoundComponent. In order to handle empty path we can redirectTo option in routes. redirectTo option as the name suggests allows to redirect from one path to an existing route. Example:
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {path: '', redirectTo: '/comp01', pathMatch: 'full'},
  {path: 'comp01', component: Comp01Component},
  {path: 'comp02', component: Comp02Component},
  {path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent},
];
```

Here whenever we type the base url "http://localhost:4200" the browser will automatically redirect to "http://localhost:4200/comp01" due to the redirecting route configured for empty path.

## Route Parameters
We can pass parameters in the route so that the component for the route can receive these parameters. The caller component can pass the parameters in the path, and once the target component is loaded based on the path/route, it retrieve the parameters passed by the caller. To implement thiswe have three steps:
- Define the route with path containing parameter (the path of route contains the parameter prefixed with a `:`)
- Implement the Component that can receive the parameter
- Pass the parameter to route when redirecting to the route (Use the `Router` component to call the route with parameter)

### 1. Defining Route with Parameters
The route can be created like this (refer the route definition for `BookComponent`):
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {path: 'book/:isbn', component: BookComponent},
  {path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent},
];
```
Here the `:isbn` denotes that the route will receive a parameter with name `isbn`. The path of the route here is `book`. The above code is the route definition in the `RoutingModule`.

### 2. Implementation of Component with Route Parameter
We can retrieve the parameter passed to the route by using `ActivatedRoute` service.
```typescript
...
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
...
export class BookComponent implements OnInit {
  bookIsbn: string;
  constructor(private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute) { }
  ngOnInit() {
    this.bookIsbn = this.activatedRoute.snapshot.paramMap.get('isbn');
  }
}
```
* The ActivatedRoute is a service, so it should be injected in the constructor of the calling component.
* The `activatedRoute.snapshot.paramMap.get` method should be called to retrieve the parameter passed to the route. The argument passed to the `get` method is the same as the parameter name defined in the routing module.
* **Caution**: This approach has a limitation. Since a snapshot of the activated route is used, navigating from the component to same component with parameters  (like moving between pages in pagniation) does not work properly. The value of the parameter will remain same even after we reload with a different value for parameter. An alternate is provided in point 4 below.

### 3. Pass the parameter to route when redirecting to the route
To Router.navigate method can be called from the typescript to navigate to the target route. An extra arugment is what it takes to send the parameter when going to the route.
```typescript
...
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-book',
  template: ` <p> Found book {{bookIsbn}} </p> `,
  styles: []
})
export class AppComponent {
  ...
  protected textIsbn: string;
  constructor(private router: Router) { }
  findBook() {
    this.router.navigate(['/book', this.textIsbn]);
  }
}
```
* The Router is a service, so it should be injected in the constructor of the calling component.
* The nagivate method takes an array as argument. The first itemin the array is the path of the route, while the second item in array is the parameter value we wish to pass to the new (target) component.
* As the `textIsbn` parameter is bound to the view we can bind the value to view using interpolation. The line ```  template: ` <p> Found book {{bookIsbn}} </p> `,``` in the above example.

### 4. Implementation of Component with Route Parameter (dynamic)
We can retrieve the parameter passed to the route by using `ActivatedRoute` service by subscribing to the `paramMap` observable:

```typescript
...
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
...
export class BookComponent implements OnInit {
  bookIsbn: string;
  constructor(private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute) { }
  ngOnInit() {
    this.activatedRoute.paramMap.subscribe( (paramMap: ParamMap) => {
      this.bookIsbn = paramMap.get('isbn');
    });
  }
}
```
* The ActivatedRoute is a service, so it should be injected in the constructor of the calling component.
* The `activatedRoute.paramMap.subscribe` will be fired every time the page loads with a new value for the parameter. The `paramMap` argument on the callback methods is always the latest parameter map; so we can call `paramMap.get` method to retrieve latest value for our route parameter.

## Passing optional parameters
If the route does not specify the parameter in the path, then we can still pass a parameter to the target component.
```typescript
// STEP 1: [app-routing.module.ts file] route entry in the routing module
const routes: Routes = [
  {path: 'book', component: BookComponent},
  {path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent},
];

// STEP 2: [index.component.ts file] Calling route with optional parameter
this.router.navigate(['/book', {name: 'introducing angular'}]);

// STEP 3: [book.component.ts file] recieving the parameter
ngOnInit() {
    this.activatedRoute.paramMap.subscribe( (paramMap: ParamMap) => {
      this.bookName = paramMap.get('name');
    });
  }
```
In the above example, the user will be navigating from the index component to the book component:
* The route (in routing module) for the book component does not define any parameter. The path for this route is simply `/book`.
* The index component navigates to book component with a route paramter. The route parameter is an object with name value pairs inside. So we can pass one or more optional parameters here.
* The book component simply fetches the value of parameter `name` inside the callback method for `ActivatedRoute.paramMap` observable.
* When the navigation happens, the application navigates from index component to the url: `http://localhost:4200/book;name=introducing+angular`. Note that the optional parameter is appended to the end of the url after a semicolon `;`.
* Each optional parameter (name-value pair in the object passed to `router.navigate` method) will be appended after one semicolon `;` in the URL. If we pass multiple params the url will be appended with something like: `http://localhost:4200/book;author=any;year=2020;subject=angular`

## Relative routes
The navigate to a path relative to the current path, use the `relateiveTo` option in the `router.navigate` method like this:
```typescript
// Declarations
import { Router, ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
// Constructor
constructor(private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute ) {  }
// Navigation
this.router.navigate([{year: 2020}], {relativeTo: this.route});
```
In the above example, if the current component's route path is `/book`, then navigation will ensure the route is navigating to same component by means of the `{relativeTo: this.route}` parameter.


## Child Routes
The child routes can be added as children attribute inside an existing route like this:
```typescript
import { BookComponent } from './books/book/book.component';
import { AuthorComponent } from './books/author/author.component';
import { PublisherComponent } from './books/publisher/publisher.component';
// Define routes
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'book/:isbn', component: BookComponent,
    children: [
      { path: 'author', component: AuthorComponent },
      { path: 'publisher', component: PublisherComponent }
    ]
  },
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent },
];
```
* Add the children to the exising route as shown in example above.
* Add the `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` to the HTML template of the parent component (in this example: BookComponent).
* If the components in child route are inside a sub-module (e.g: `./books/books.module.ts`), the `router-outlet` tag may not work. In order to make it work, import the RouterModule ( in `@angular/router`) in the sub-module (e.g: `./books/books.module.ts`) and add the RouterModule in the `imports` section.
* Navigation from parent component (`BookComponent`). To navigate from parent component use the relativeUrl syntax: `this.router.navigate(['publisher'], {relativeTo: this.activatedRoute});`. This will trigger navigation from `http://localhost:4200/book/<isbn>` to the new route `http://localhost:4200/books/<isbn>/publisher` which is the child route.
